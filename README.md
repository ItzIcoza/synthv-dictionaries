# Synthesizer V Studio Dictionaries
## Language Dictionaries for Synthesizer V Studio

# Usage

The folder name dictates the Voicebanks the dictionary will be compatible with.
For example, if you download the ``japanese-romaji`` dictionaries, voicebanks such as Frimomen, Kasane Teto & Mai will be supported, but not ones such as Eleanor Forte or ANRI.
However, if you download the ``english-arpabet`` dictionaries, banks such as Eleanor Forte and ANRI will be supported, but any other bank who's primary language (aka the "Default" selection) won't work with it.
> Note: You can download multiple folders, meaning you can have all three folders downloaded.

# IMPORTANT
To use the dictionaries, you **MUST** change the voicebank language to English. The folder names only indicate which voicebanks the dictionaries are compatible with.
